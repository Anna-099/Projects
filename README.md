📊# Data Science & Healthcare Projects
This repository includes independent data science projects I developed alongside my professional work, exploring health data, cognitive phenomena, and statistical analysis using Python. These projects reflect my personal interest in applying analytical methods to real-world problems in health and cognition. 

🔍 Projects Overview

💉1. Diabetes Health Indicators
File: Diabetes_Health_Indicators.ipynb
Analyzes health data to explore correlations and predictors of diabetes using data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning.
Techniques: Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, XGB
Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

👁️2. Self-Motion Illusion Simulation
File: Self_motion_illusion.ipynb
Simulates and visualizes the cognitive phenomenon of self-motion illusions using visual stimuli.
Techniques: Drift Diffusion Model, Stochastic Noise Modeling, Monte Carlo simulations
Language: Python
Libraries: matplotlib, numpy, scipy

🚀How to Run
Open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
