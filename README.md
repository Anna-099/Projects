📊 Data Science & Healthcare Projects

This repository includes independent data science projects I developed alongside my professional work, exploring health data, cognitive phenomena, and statistical analysis using Python. These projects reflect my personal interest in applying analytical methods to real-world problems in health and cognition. 

🔍 Projects Overview
